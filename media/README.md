# Vorpal Graphics Engine

## Concern
The graphics engine is a core concern that provides rendering, concurrent pipelines, and utils that may be used by any of the engine implementations. While it wil obviously be used by the Native engine, it is also useful for doing work in a concurrent safe fashion off the main rendering thread for engines like Raylib.
